* Welding workflow modules
  This repository contains the modules for automatically creating the  files required for 
  simulating a welding case by CalculiX based on the user specifications/output files from a web interface. 
  The modules create mesh files, convert them to CalculiX input format, create CalculiX input files, and 
  CalculiX user defined heat source file, =dflux.f= for defining the heat source for welding steps.

** Required software
   - The geometry and mesh is generated using [[http://www.salome-platform.org/][Salome platform]] (version 8.2.0)
   - The thrmomechanical simulation of the welding process is performed with the open source [[http://www.dhondt.de/][CalculiX FEA solver]] (version 2.12)
** Instructions
   Instructions for running the files are in =docs/Instruction_flow.pdf=
** Authors
   The modules are created by [[https://ewi.org/][EWI]]
